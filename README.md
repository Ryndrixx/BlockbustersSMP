## Setup

### Install Curseforge & Modpack Profile

1. Download [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app#download-options) (select the standalone version for your OS)
2. Once inside the Curseforge launcher, click the *+* on the top left to *Add a game*. Select *Scan computer for games* and that should automatically locate your Minecraft installation. (If it does not, type *%appdata%*  in the search bar of your Start Menu and hit     enter, double click the *.Minecraft* folder and copy-paste the directory under *Manually add a game* in the Curseforge launcher.)
3. Once you've successfully added Minecraft to your games on Curseforge, install the latest version of the modpack profile for [BlockbustersSMP](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/blockbusterssmp/install/6469315)  (if the link does not work, just head to     the *Minecraft* tab you added on the lefthand sidebar, and in the search bar at the top enter *BlockbustersSMP* and you should see our modpack come up.)
4. Once the modpack installs you are ready to play, no additional setup required. However, **PLEASE READ THE RECOMMENDED SETTTINGS BEFORE CONTINUING!**

### Recommended Settings

**It is highly recommended that you read this list and apply any necessary/desired settings to avoid any unwanted issues or poor performance**  

 Head to the *Curseforge* settings, under *Game Specific*, select *Minecraft*
 
 1. Under *Launcher Settings* select *Skip Launcher with Curseforge*
 2. Under *Allocated Memory* it is recommended to select *Recommended by author*. Either way, make sure your RAM slider is set to 8000MB. Now this can be a little more complicated. You may need to adjust this based on     your system hardware, i.e., if you know you      have only 12GB of system RAM, and using 8GB on minecraft isn't leaving enough for your machines basic funcions/tasks, you may need to turn it down some. That being said,     if you find yourself wanting to increase the slider, know that it is not recommended to      exceed 8GB, and anything more than 12GB is 100% overkill, and will almost certainly cause issues.
